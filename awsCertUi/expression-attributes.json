The company has a large set of claims and a compliance label for each.<br />Each claim consists of a few sentences in English, many of which contain complex related<br />information. Management would like to use Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms to design a<br />machine learning supervised model that can be trained to read each claim and predict if the claim is<br />compliant or not.<br />Which approach should be used to extract features from the claims to be used as inputs for the<br />downstream supervised task?"}
