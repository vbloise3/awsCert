IAM 101
  - IAM allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.
  - IAM gives you
    - Centralized control of your AWS account
    - Shared access to your AWS account
    - Granular permissions
    - Enables identity federation (including Active Directory, Facebook, Linkedin, etc.)
    - Allows multi-factor authentication
    - Provides temporary access for users/devices and services
    - Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy
    - Integrates with many different AWS services
    - Supports PCI (Payment Card Industry) DSS compliance

  - Critical terms
    - Users - end users (think people)
    - Groups - a collection of users under one set of permissions
    - Roles - create roles and then assign them to AWS resources
    - Policies - a document that defines one (or more) permissions; can be attached to either a user, a group, or a role

IAM 101 Lab
  - The IAM dashboard gives you a sign in link in the form of a url with your customer # as the first part of the url
  - You can customize your sign in link to replace the customer # part of the url with a more readable name
  - You use groups to assign permissions to sets of users
  - You can activate MFA on your user's accounts for further security
  - IAM dashboard gives you a checklist telling you to
    - Delete your root access keys
    - Activate MFA on your root account
    - Use groups to assign permissions
    - Apply an IAM password policy
  - With MFA you can use either a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device
    - an example of a virtual MFA device is Google Authenticator on your iPhone
  - Two types of access for users
    - programatic access: enables an access key ID and a secret access key for AWS API, CLI, SDK, and other development tools
    - AWS Management Console access: enables a password that allows users to sign-in to the AWS console
  - Three ways to add permissions to a user:
    - Add the user to a group with the permissions you want
    - Copy permissions from another user
    - Attach existing policies directly
  - IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust. Examples:
    - IAM user in another account
    - Application code running on an EC2 instance that needs to perform actions on AWS resources
    - An AWS service that needs to act on resources in your account to provide its features
    - Users from a corporate directory who use identity federation with SAML
  - IAM roles issue keys that are valid for short durations, making them a more secure way to grant access
IAM 101 Summary
  - IAM is universal, so it doesn't apply to specific regions
  - The root account is the account created when you first setup your AWS account
  - The root account has complete admin access
  - The root account id is the email account you used when you first setup your AWS account
  - New users have no permissions when they are first created
  - New users are assigned an access key ID and secret access key when first created

EC2 101
  - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the Cloud
  - Can pay for EC2 by the hour or even by the second
  - EC2 Options
    - On Demand Instances - allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment
      - Linux instances are charged by the second
      - Windows instances are charged by the hour
    - Reserved Instances - provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instances
      - 1 year or 3 year terms
    - Spot Instances - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times
    - Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses
  - Use cases for the pricing models
    - One Demand Instances
      - users who want the low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
      - applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
      - applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first times
    - Reserved Instances
      - applications with steady state or predictable usage
      - applications that require reserved capacity
      - users can make up-front payments to reduce the total computing costs even further
      - standard RIs (up to 75% off on-demand)
      - Convertible RIs (up to 54% off on-demand) feature the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of an RI of equal or greater value
      - Scheduled RIs are available to launch within the time window you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, week, or month
    - Spot instances
      - applications that have flexible start and end times
      - applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
      - users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity
    - Dedicated Hosts
      - useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
      - great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
      - can be purchased on-demand (hourly)
      - can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price

          - Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important
  - Exam Tips
    - If a spot instance is terminated by Amazon, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage
    - If you terminate an instance yourself, you will be charged for the complete hour in which the instance ran
