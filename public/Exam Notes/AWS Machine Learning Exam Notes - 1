Data Collection

Data Collection Concepts
 - should have at least 10 times as many data points as the total number of features
General Data Terminology
 - Dataset: a collection of data
   - dataset = input data = training/testing data
   - column = attribute = feature
   - row = observation = sample = data point
 - Structured data
   - has a defined schema, the schema is the information needed to interpret the data, including attribute names and their assigned data types
 - Unstructured data
   - has no defined schema or structural properties. Makes up majority of data collected
 - Semi-structured data
   - It is too unstructured to for relational data, but has some organizational structure. Usually in the form of CSV, JSON, or XML
 - Data Warehouse: usually has some pre-processing done before data is loaded into it
   - processing done on import (schema-on-write)
   - data classified /stored with user in mind
   - ready to be used with BI tools (query and analysis)
 - Data Lake: no pre-processing before data is loaded into it
   - processing done on export (schema-on-read)
   - many different sources and formats
   - raw data may not be ready for use
Machine Learning Data Terminology
 - labeled data
   - data where we already know what the target attribute is
 - unlabeled data
   - data that has been collected with no target attribute
