EC2 Lab
  - EC2 instances are created from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
  - Detailed CloudWatch monitoring monitors every minute, versus every 5 minutes for default monitoring
  - Use the EC2 User Data section under Advanced Details to create a bootstrap script
  - The EC2 Security Group is a virtual firewall controlling traffic in and out to your EC2 instance
  - You need a public key and private key pair to launch an EC2 instance
  - The public key to an EC2 instance is like the lock and the private key is the key to the lock
Elastic Load Balancers
  - Three types of load balancers
     - Application Load Balancer: operates at OSI layer 7
     - Network Load Balancer: operates at OSI layer 4; used for very fast performance routing; most expensive ELB
     - Classic Load Balancer: legacy, no longer recommended
  - Application load balancers
     - best suited for http and https traffic
     - operate at layer 7 and are application aware
  - Network load balancers
     - best suited for tcp traffic where extreme performance is required
     - operate at the connection level (layer 4)
     - capable of handling millions of requests per second
     - maintains ultra-low latency
  - Classic load balancers
     - can load balance http/https applications
     - use layer 7-specific features such as sticky sessions, but not as intelligent as application load balancer on layer 7
     - can also function as strict layer 4 for applications that rely purely on tcp traffic
     - if your application is having issues, the classic load balancer will respond with a 504 (gateway timeout) meaning the application is not responding within the idle timeout period
       - remediate by scaling up or out
  - X-Forwarded-For header
     - used to get the user requesting ip address (the IPv4 address) that is behind the ELB
Route 53
  - Route 53 is AWS's DNS service
  - Route 53 allows you to map your domain names to
     - EC2 Instances
     - Load Balancers
     - S3 Buckets
     - CloudFront Distributions
     - Elastic Beanstalk environments
  - An Alias in Route 53 tells Route 53 where to route a request to the domain name associated with the Alias
  - Record Set types
     - A - IPv4 address
     - CNAME - Canonical name
     - MX - Mail Exchange
     - AAAA - IPv6 address
     - TXT - text
     - PTR - pointer
     - SRV - Service locator
     - SPF - Sender Policy Framework
     - NAPTR - Name Authority Pointer
     - CAA - Certification Authority Authorization
     - SOA - Start of Authority
  - The Zone Apex Record, or naked domain name, is the domain without any prefix, such as vincebloise.com versus www.vincebloise.com
  - When selecting an A Record, you can choose an Alias, which in Route 53 is an alias for an AWS resource
  - An Alias in Route 53 is created at the Zone Apex, or naked domain name level
  - An Alias in Route 53 is only supported by A and AAAA record set types
AWS CLI (START HERE)
  - Least Privilege - Always give your users the minimum amount of access required
  - Create Groups - Assign your users to groups. Your users will automatically inherit the permissions of the group. The group's
    permissions are assigned using policy documents.
  - Secret Access Key - You will this key only once. If you do not save it, you can delete the Key Pair (Access Key and Secret Access Key)
    and regenerate it. Once you generate a new key pair you will to run aws configure again.
  - Do not use just one access key - Do not create just one access key and share it with all of your developers.
    Create one key pair per developer.
  - You can use the CLI on you PC - You can install the cli on your MAC, Linux, or Windows PC.

EC2 with Roles
  - Roles allow you to not have to use Access Key IDs and Secret Access keys
  - Roles are preferred from a security perspective
  - Roles are controlled by policies
  - You can change a policy on a role and it will immediate affect on the EC2 instance
  - You can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or terminate the instance
  - When you get a question asking which to choose: Access Keys or Roles, always choose Roles
EC2 with Attached Encrypted EBS Volume
