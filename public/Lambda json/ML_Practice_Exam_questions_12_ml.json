      "question": "A manufacturer has deployed an array of 50000 sensors throughout its plant to predict failures in components. Data Scientists have built a long short-term memory (LSTM) model in Gluon and are training it using the Amazon SageMaker API. The Data Scientists are training the model using a time series with 10 million examples. Training is currently taking 100 hours and Data Scientists are attempting to speed it up by using multiple GPUs. However, when they modified the code to use 8 GPUs, it is running slightly slower than on 1 GPU. The current hyperparameter settings are: Hyperparameter Value, Batch size 128, Clip gradient 10, Autoregressive window 160, Learning rate 0.01, Epochs 80. Which of the following changes together are recommended to speed up training on 8 GPUs while maintaining test accuracy? (Select TWO)",

      "question": "A Data Scientist needs to create a model for fraud detection The dataset is composed of 2 years' worth of logged transactions, each with a small set of features All of the transactions in the dataset were manually labeled. Since fraud does not occur frequently, the dataset is highly imbalanced Less than 2% of the dataset was labeled as fraudulent. Which solution provides the optimal predictive power for classifying fraudulent activity?",

      "question": "A Machine Learning Specialist is training a model using a supervised learning algorithm. The Specialist split the dataset to use 80% of the data for training and reserved 20% of the data for testing. While evaluating the model the Specialist discovers that the mode is 97% accurate for the training dataset and 75% accurate for the test dataset. What is the reason for the discrepancy and what action should the Specialist take?",
      "answers": [
        "The high accuracy for the larger amount of training data means that the model is finished. Deploy the model to production.",
        "The mode is currently overfitting the training data and not performing as well as it should on data it has not seen before. Change the hyperparameters to simplify and generalize the model, then retrain.",
        "Additional data in the test set is needed to balance the scoring of the model. Redistribute the data more evenly across training and test sets.",
        "The mode is currently underfitting and does not have enough complexity to capture the full scope of the dataset. Change the hyperparameters to make the model more specific and complex, then retrain."

The historical ticket sales data consists of more than 1,000 records containing 20 numerical variables. During the exploratory data analysis phase, the Specialist discovered 33 records have values for a numerical variable in the far right of the box plot's upper quartile. The Specialist confirmed with a business user that those values are unusual, but plausible. There are also 70 records where another numerical variable is blank.
