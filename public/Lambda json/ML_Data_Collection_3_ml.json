      "question": "You are a ML specialist working with data that is stored in a distributed EMR cluster on AWS. Currently, your machine learning applications are compatible with the Apache Hive Metastore tables on EMR. You have been tasked with configuring Hive to use the AWS Glue Data Catalog as its metastore. Before you can do this you need to transfer the Apache Hive metastore tables into an AWS Glue Data Catalog. What are the steps you will need to take to achieve this with the LEAST amount of effort?",
