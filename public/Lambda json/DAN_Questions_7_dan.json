      "question": "You work for a mobile gaming company that has developed a word puzzle game that allows multiple users to challenge each other to complete a crossword puzzle type of game board. This interactive game works on mobile devices and web browsers. You have a world-wide user base that can play against each other no matter where each player is located. You now need to create a leaderboard component of the game architecture where players can look at the daily point leaders for the day, week, or other timeframes. Each time a player accumulates points, the points counter for that player needs to be updated in real-time. This leaderboard data is transient in that it only needs to be stored for a limited duration.
