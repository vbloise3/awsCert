      "question": "A ski equipment company is trying to predict the expected sales from a line of ski goggles. They have never sold this type of product before, but they do have some historic sales data for other products which they believe have similar market adoption curves. What would be your first algorithm of choice among the built-in SageMaker algorithms for this use-case?",

      "question": "You are a machine learning engineer on a team that is designing a deep sea exploration robot which will explore areas never before visited. The robot will be so deep that its impractical to send commands for every motion. Rather then robot needs to know how to navigate among obstacles itself while collecting data. How would you frame this problem?",
