      "question": "You are a developer for a genomics firm who are moving their infrastructure to AWS. Their environment consists of a three tier web application, a web tier, an application tier and a relational database tier. They have a separate fleet of virtual machines that are used to access large HPC clusters on the fly. Their lab researches run multiple projects simultaneously and they will need to launch and de-commission 1,000's of nodes on-demand while reducing the time required to complete genomic sequencing from weeks to days. In order to stay competitive they need to do this at as low cost as possible, with no long term contracts. These HPC clusters can run any time day or night and their workloads store information in S3, so the instances can be terminated at any time without any effect on the data. What is the most COST EFFECTIVE ec2 pricing model for their requirements?",

When new instances are launched they download a connection string file which is saved in an encrypted S3 bucket using a boot strap script. During a routine scaling event you notice that your new webservers are failing their health checks and are not coming in to service. You investigate and discover that the EC2-S3 read only role that the webservers rely on has no policies attached to it.
