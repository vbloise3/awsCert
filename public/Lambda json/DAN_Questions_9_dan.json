      "question": "39. A media company has been performing analytics on log data generated by its applications. There has been a recent increase in the number of concurrent analytics jobs running, and the overall performance of existing jobs is decreasing as the number of new jobs is increasing. The partitioned data is stored inAmazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) and the analytic processing is performed on Amazon EMR clusters using the EMR File System(EMRFS) with consistent view enabled. A data analyst has determined that it is taking longer for the EMR task nodes to list objects in Amazon S3.Which action would MOST likely increase the performance of accessing log data in Amazon S3?",
      "answers": [
        "Use a hash function to create a random string and add that to the beginning of the object prefixes when storing the log data in Amazon S3.",
        "Use a lifecycle policy to change the S3 storage class to S3 Standard for the log data.",

      "question": "40. A company has developed several AWS Glue jobs to validate and transform its data from Amazon S3 and load it into Amazon RDS for MySQL in batches once every day. The ETL jobs read the S3 data using a DynamicFrame. Currently, the ETL developers are experiencing challenges in processing only the incremental data on every run, as the AWS Glue job processes all the S3 input data on each run.Which approach would allow the developers to solve the issue with minimal coding effort?",
      "answers": [
        "Have the ETL jobs read the data from Amazon S3 using a DataFrame.",
        "Enable job bookmarks on the AWS Glue jobs.",
        "Create custom logic on the ETL jobs to track the processed S3 objects.",
        "Have the ETL jobs delete the processed objects or data from Amazon S3 after each run."
