      "question": "60. A company is streaming its high-volume billing data (100 MBps) to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. A data analyst partitioned the data on account_id to ensure that all records belonging to an account go to the same Kinesis shard and order is maintained. While building a custom consumer using the Kinesis Java SDK, the data analyst notices that, sometimes, the messages arrive out of order for account_id. Upon further investigation, the data analyst discovers the messages that are out of order seem to be arriving from different shards for the same account_id and are seen when a stream resize runs.What is an explanation for this behavior and what is the solution?",
